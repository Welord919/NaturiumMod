Mod made by me just to create a few items I wanted to make. There is a good few items, these include Weapons, Armor (One set), Ore, and an enemy. There is no boss currently, but plan to make one in the future. Pretty much all of the items go up to WOF level, but the there are items for every class, both Early and Mid/Late HM. The mod has two main gimmicks: Almost every item uses either Barkion's Bark/Naturium Ore, and the "Archetype" system.

Barkions Bark is made from Wood and Acorns, used to make most early game weapons and the Armor set.
Naturium Ore/Bars to make almost everything else with, which you need the respective Evil Bar and some Naturium Ore.

The "Archetype" system uses the name of the Armor or Weapon to classify it into an Archetype to be able to buff these Items with its respective medallion. You will get the first from the Druid, which these can be upgraded into the better-tier medallions.

I hope you enjoy my little project here, of course comment if there is something you find that is broken, or if the balancing is off.

Other notes: There are currently two items that are Post-Mech, the enemy is found in the Undergroud, and Please use the Guide to see the crafting recipes for both Barkion's Bark and Naturium (this helps a lot). Also made some discussion posts to put in your input.
